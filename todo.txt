things to immediately address, given the time...

* Adaptive step sizing for implicit methods is crucial.

* Handling non-convergence of Newton's method(s) with implicit methods. The Newton solver can return a code indicating success/failure. If failure, take smaller steps?

* Initial guess of k values for nonlinear solves in implicit methods.

* L-stable Rosenbrock method.

* Look into extra steps taken when snapping in an adaptive solves.

* Compiler warnings with long long datatypes with old g++ versions

* Tridiagonal matrix support
